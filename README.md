Flood Monitoring System

Project Definition:

Creating a flood monitoring and early warning system with an ESP32 and Wokwi . Here is a sample code Below is a step-by-step guide on how to implement this project.

Design Thinking:

Hardware Required:

1. ESP32 Development Board (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32)

2. Water level sensor (e.g., a float switch or water level sensor)

3. Buzzer or speaker for the alarm

4. Wokwi account (for simulating the project online)

5. Internet connection for Wokwi simulation

Step 1: Setting up the Wokwi Environment

1. Visit the Wokwi website (https://wokwi.com/).

2. Create an account if you don't have one already.

3. Once logged in, click on "Create a new simulation."

4. Select "ESP32 DevKit" as your board.

Step 2: Connecting the Hardware in Wokwi

1. In the Wokwi simulator, you can add components like the ESP32, water level sensor, and buzzer/speaker by dragging them from the components panel onto the virtual breadboard.

2. Connect the components using virtual jumper wires. Connect the power and ground pins appropriately.

3. Connect the water level sensor to an analog input pin on the ESP32. 4. Connect the buzzer/speaker to a digital output pin on the ESP32. Step 3: Writing the Arduino Code

Here's a simple Arduino code example to get you started with flood monitoring and early warning. This code reads the water level from the sensor and triggers the alarm when the water level exceeds a certain threshold.

cpp

#define VWATER_SENSOR_PIN AO

#define BUZZERPIN 2

#define WATER THRESHOLD 500 / Adjust this threshold as needed void setup() {

pinMode(WATER_SENSOR_ PIN, INPUT);

pinMode(BUZZER PIN, OUTPUT);

void loop){

int waterlLevel = analog Read(WATER_SENSOR PIN);

if (waterLevel > WATER_THRESHOLD) {

Il Water level is above the threshold, trigger the alarm

digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, HIGH);

delay(1000); // Alarm on for 1 second

digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, LOW):

delay(1000); // Delay to prevent constant alarms

I| Add more code here for sending warnings to a server or other actions.

Upload this code to your ESP32 in the Wokwi simulator.

Step 4: Simulate the Flood Monitoring

1. In the VWokwi simulator, click on the "Start Simulation" button to run your project.

2. Simulate the water level sensor by clicking on it and changing its value to simulate rising water levels.

3. Observe how the buzzerlspeaker activates when the water level exceeds the threshold. Step 5: Real-World Implementation (Optional)

To implement this project in the real world, you will need to:

1. Purchase the necessary hardware components (ESP32, water level sensor, buzzer).
2. Set up your ESP32 development environment (Arduino IDE or PlatformlO).
3. Connect the real hardware following the same connections as in the Wokwi simulation.
4. Upload the Arduino code to your ESP32.
5. Deploy the system in the area you want to monitor for floods.
6. Consider adding additional features like sending alerts to a server or smartphone.

Remember that this is a basic example, and you can expand upon it to create a more robust flood monitoring and early warning system. Additionally, consider adding power backup solutions and other safety measures for real-world applications.
